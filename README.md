# A port of user switching to Termux using proot!
(and su+sudo can be used as fake root as well, my treat.)

 Yes, I have a script that installs a reimplementation of su with Alpine for switching users and root shell. To make life easier, you also have links to adduser and delusee in Alpine too!

 TO-DO:

 [] Add add/delgroup
 
 [] Make a better manpage
