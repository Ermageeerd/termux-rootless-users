# A port of user switching to Termux using proot!
(and su+sudo can be used as fake root as well, my treat.)

 Yes, I have a script that installs a reimplementation of su with Alpine for switching users and root shell. To make life easier, you also have links to adduser and deluser in Alpine too!

 TO-DO:

 [] Add add/delgroup
 
 [] Make a better manpage

# How to install:

- Clone the repo.
- Extract the files.
- Run either install.sh or install-all.sh.

# Why are there two?

Because not everyone wants the the full user system. I'm trying to give a choice.
